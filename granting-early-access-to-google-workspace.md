# Grant Early Access to Beta Features for Admin Groups

## Overview

 This guide explains how to allow Admin groups in your organization gain early access to some of **Google Workspace**'s new features, including improved Docs tools or Meet layouts. It will assist you in testing these features safely with a small group and get their feedback without affecting the entire organization. This feature will provide greater control and it will support gradual rollouts to minimize disruption.
 
## Steps

To assign Beta features to Admin groups in **Google Workspace**, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Admin console at (https://admin.google.com) using your admin email and password. 

    > If you've forgotten your email or password, check with your IT team or the person who set up Google Workspace. You can also click on **Forgot Email?** or **Forgot Password?** which are shown under the website.

2. Go to "Apps" in the left menu and click on **Additional Google Services**. This section lists extra tools and features you can enable.

3. Find and click **Early Access Apps** in the list and select **Beta Features**. This shows available beta features, like new tools for Docs or Meet.

4. Choose a group (a team or department you've set up in Google Workspace) to give beta access to. Click **Turn On for This Group**. If you haven't created groups, ask your IT team to set them up first.

5. Click **Save** to apply the changes. (It may take up to 24 hours for the group to start using the beta features.)

## Reminder

> Make sure your team or department is set up as a group in Google Workspace before you begin. Beta features are still being tested and might not work perfectly, so avoid using them for critical tasks. 

## Confirmation Message

When you see the following message appear, the Beta features have successfully been added to your team.

***Beta features are now enabled for this group.***
