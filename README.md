# Beta-Features-Google-Workspace# Beta Features Google Workspace

## Overview

This project is a take-home assignment created during the interview process for a technical writing position at Google. I was tasked to write a technical documentation for a fictional **Google Workspace** feature: granting early access to beta features for admin groups.

While the feature itself is not currently available in Workspace, it is modeled after real-world admin tools and workflows to demonstrate my ability to create clear and helpful documentation under realistic constraints. I also reviewed various help articles published by Google to ensure my tone and style align with their guidelines.

## Deliverable

A Help Center-style article that explains

- What the feature does
- Why it's useful for IT admins
- How to enable it, step by step
- Warnings and confirmation messages

## Tools Used

- Visual Studio Code
- Markdown
- Gemini AI
